### Useful resources

📚 Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)  
  This helped me understand how to use Flexbox for centering and aligning items on the page. The diagrams and examples were super clear and practical.

- [CSS Tricks - Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)  
  A great visual reference I kept coming back to while working on the layout. The explanations are concise and easy to follow.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  
  I used this to explore clean, readable font options like *Inter* and *Roboto*. It makes a big difference in the overall look of the card.
